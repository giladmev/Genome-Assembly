------------------------------
See 'contig_length_distribution.png' for a visual representation.

3. Analysis
------------
Comparison between error-free and error-prone assemblies:
- Contig Count: Difference of -1235
- Largest Contig: Difference of -370
- N50: Difference of 0
- Genome Fraction: Difference of 0.0
- Total Assembly Length: Difference of -197631

Interpretation:
- A lower contig count generally indicates a more contiguous assembly.
- Larger contigs and higher N50 values suggest better assembly quality.
- Higher genome fraction indicates better coverage of the reference genome.
- The total assembly length should ideally be close to the reference genome length.

4. Conclusions
--------------
Unexpectedly, the error-prone assembly shows higher contiguity. This might be due to aggressive merging of reads despite errors.
The error-prone assembly unexpectedly covers more of the reference genome. This might indicate over-assembly or duplication.

5. Recommendations
-------------------
- Consider implementing error correction techniques to improve the error-prone assembly.
- Experiment with different overlap lengths and mismatch tolerances in the assembly algorithm.
- Validate assemblies using additional metrics such as BUSCO scores for gene completeness.
- Consider using more sophisticated assembly algorithms that can handle repeats and resolve ambiguities better.
