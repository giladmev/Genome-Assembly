------------------------------
See 'data/output\contig_length_distribution.png' for a visual representation.

3. Analysis
------------
Comparison between error-free and error-prone assemblies:
- Contig Count: Difference of -1882
- Largest Contig: Difference of 3948
- N50: Difference of 3862
- Genome Fraction: Difference of 75.15781656145563
- Total Assembly Length: Difference of -374172

Interpretation:
- A lower contig count generally indicates a more contiguous assembly.
- Larger contigs and higher N50 values suggest better assembly quality.
- Higher genome fraction indicates better coverage of the reference genome.
- The total assembly length should ideally be close to the reference genome length.

4. Conclusions
--------------
The error-free assembly appears to be more contiguous, as expected.
The error-free assembly covers more of the reference genome, indicating better completeness.

5. Recommendations
-------------------
- Consider implementing error correction techniques to improve the error-prone assembly.
- Experiment with different overlap lengths and mismatch tolerances in the assembly algorithm.
- Validate assemblies using additional metrics such as BUSCO scores for gene completeness.
- Consider using more sophisticated assembly algorithms that can handle repeats and resolve ambiguities better.
